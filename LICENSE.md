 Author's Note:
 I'm not doing this for profit — I just care deeply about this project and want to see it grow in the best possible way. 
 While I’m not currently planning to monetize it and will likely grant permission to fork it if you ask, 
 I know there's nothing stopping someone from just ignoring that.

 That’s why I’ve chosen to go with a stricter license rather than a permissive one — 
 just to keep everything clear and under control.
